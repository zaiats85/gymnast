Display native WordPress galleries in a responsive justified image grid and a pretty lightbox.


== Description ==

This simple plugin brings the native WordPress gallery to a higher level by adding a nice justified image grid and a pretty lightbox.
**Just install and activate the plugin. That's all.**

Create galleries as before, but enjoy the **responsive layout**, beautiful **justified image grid** and handy **lightbox**. 

I love the native WordPress gallery. It’s easy to use and as intuitive as possible. Everything would be perfect if it were not for the column layout and lack of lightbox. Many themes display the WordPress gallery in an ugly and “no eye-catching” way. This was my inspiration to write this simple plugin.

= Demo =
See how it works on the [DEMO](http://damiangora.com/justified-gallery) site.

= Features =
*  **Easy to use**. You can use the native WordPress gallery just as you did before
*  Beautiful, justified layout thanks to [Justified Gallery by Miro](http://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery)
*  **Support of image descriptions**. Descriptions can also be turned off on a settings page
*  **Lightbox**. The gallery can be viewed with popular [PhotoSwipe](http://photoswipe.com/) by Dmitry Semenov
*  **Responsiveness**. The gallery adapts to various screen width options. It works perfectly on mobile devices
*  **High quality images**. The URL of images is tailored to the needs in an intelligent way. Smaller images will be download on smaller screens, larger images on larger screens
*  Justify your images without cropping them
*  **Configurable**. You can set up a width of the gap between images and height of rows

= How to use? =
